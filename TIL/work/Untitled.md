One possible way to refactor this method would be to use Java's reflection API to dynamically set the properties of the `DataArchive` object based on the corresponding properties in the `DataArchiveDTO` object. This would reduce the amount of repetitive code and make the method more flexible and maintainable.

Here is an example implementation of this approach:

scssCopy code
```java
public static void toEntity(DataArchive dataArchive, DataArchiveDTO dataArchiveDTO) throws IllegalAccessException {
    Field[] fields = dataArchive.getClass().getDeclaredFields();
    for (Field field : fields) {
        field.setAccessible(true);
        Object value = field.get(dataArchiveDTO);
        if (value != null) {
            field.set(dataArchive, value);
        }
    }
}

```


In this implementation, we use the `getDeclaredFields` method to obtain all the fields (i.e., properties) of the `DataArchive` object. We then loop through each field, make it accessible, and get the corresponding value from the `DataArchiveDTO` object using the `get` method. If the value is not null, we set it in the `DataArchive` object using the `set` method.

Note that we also added a `throws IllegalAccessException` to the method signature since we are accessing private fields. You can catch this exception or propagate it up the call stack as appropriate.

Using this approach, we can reduce the amount of code needed to set the properties of the `DataArchive` object, and the method will automatically handle any changes to the properties in the future without requiring additional updates to the `toEntity` method.
